            <h3>What is app development?</h3>
            <p style="text-align:center ;">App development is the process in which developers create an application to
                be used on smartphones,
                tablets and other mobile devices. While app development sometimes involves creating a web-based app or a
                desktop version of the app, the majority of app development projects are deployed to mobile and tablet
                devices.

            <h3>The App Development Lifecycle</h3>
            <p style="text-align:center ;">The app development lifecycle features several steps involved in a typical
                app development project. These
                steps include:

                    <ol class="olist">
                        <li>Planning
                            This first stage involves completing a business analysis and creating a mobile strategy. A
                            business
                            analysis, marketer and project manager are usually involved.</li>
                        <li> Technical
                            In this next stage, a technical writer is responsible for describing all technical details
                            and requirements.</li>
                        <li>Prototyping
                            In the prototyping phase, the sketch, wireframes and app skins are created. This is usually
                            completed by a UX/UI designer.</li>
                        <li>Developing
                            This phase includes front-end and back-end coding segments and is performed by developers.
                        </li>
                        <li>Quality
                            During the quality assurance phase, tech requirements are tested and the device capability
                            is reviewed to ensure that the app is working as it should.
                        </li>
                        <li>Publishing
                            Finally, the app is published to the app store. Maintenance is provided on an ongoing basis
                            as updates, new releases and new bugs arise.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="p1">During the coding process, developers encounter two main types of paths:<br>
                <strong>Front End</strong> developers focus on how an app looks, while <strong>Back End</strong>
                developers focus on how an app works.<br>
                <u>For example, if you were building an app, the front-end developer would be in charge of creating the
                    theme, style, presentation, and images.
                    The back-end developer would work on the database, as well as the site’s security, users and overall
                    site performance. Programming languages can alsodiffer. For example, front end developers often use
                    HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, while back end users may use Ruby, PHP, Python, Java.

            <h4>No-Code</h4>
            <p>
                No-code doesn't mean anti-code. There will always be a place for developers and their expertise. But not
                knowing how to code shouldn't stop people from being able to launch their ideas, build businesses, and
                follow their entrepreneurial aspirations. It's exciting to see so many no code development platforms out
                there opening up the gateways for non-programmers to create.
            </p>

            <h4>What is No-Code?</h4>
            <p>
                No-code frameworks are software design systems that allow even non-technical people to execute software
                without composing a line of code.
                These tools usually have a user-friendly interface and drag-and-drop capabilities, allowing you to
                envision the implementation process and describe the overall business logic with ease.
                A no-code framework is a programming platform that uses a visual development interface to enable
                non-technical users to build applications by dragging and dropping software components to create a full
                app. Users don’t need any previous coding experience to build applications using no-code.
            </p>

            <h4>Why No-Code?</h4>

                <li>Methodological approach towards building No-Code apps in 50% less time.</li>
                <li>Reduce the cost of development by up to 80%.</li>
                <li>You will be able to attract better clients, who pay for the value and not for the hours.</li>
                <li>Higher paying jobs.</li>
                <li>Be an independent professional.</li>
                <li>You will be able to advice your clients on No-Code.</li>
                <li>Develop Logical Thinking.</li>
                <li>No-code automation systems minimize mistakes and speed up business operations while still reducing
                    routine and redundant tasks. It is why the majority of teams opt for no-code.</li>

                need to write complex scripts from scratch.</p>
            <h5>Small Businesses</h5>
            <p>Selling online has never been easier and more accessible. Take your business to the internet and let the
                whole world buy from you.</p>
            <h5>Developers</h5>
            <p>Why spend months to build software, when you can use a No-Code tool to quickly build a product and write
                code only to enhance its capabilities even further.</p>
